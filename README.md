Android Image Animation Project (Java)

This Android project demonstrates how to implement various animations in an Android application using Java. The app showcases image animations such as fade in, fade out, scale, and rotate, all triggered by user interaction through button clicks.

    Fade Out Animation: Gradually fades the image out of view.
    Scale Animation: Increases or decreases the size of the image.
    Rotate Animation: Rotates the image to create a dynamic visual effect.

Technologies:

    Language: Java
    Animations: Using Android's built-in Animation class
    Buttons: Each animation is triggered by a button click in the UI.

Usage:

Clone the repository, open it in Android Studio, and run it on an Android emulator or device. Press any of the buttons to trigger the corresponding animation on the image.
